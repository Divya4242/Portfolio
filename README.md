# Project-05

I'm excited to share my portfolio website with you all! ðŸŽ‰ In this website, I've included details about my minor and major projects, Prominent Cloud Certifications, as well as my acadamic status and skills. You can check it out https://divyapatell.azurewebsites.net/

### About Portfolio
Creating this website was a great opportunity for me to showcase my work and highlight my abilities. 
I wanted to make sure that it was easy to navigate and provided all the necessary information.
I believe this will provide a good insight into my skills and experience as a developer.
